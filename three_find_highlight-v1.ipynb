At least you know most of the time a lot of what we think about time and and how we keep track of. It is relatively recent and some aspects that we take for granted aren't actually all that universal and today we're going to be talking to a few of my young colleagues for a set of many stories about our evolving relationship with time and to get US started. It's Kirk Coolsa, the CO author of the nine hundred percent invisible city, and in our book we wrote about the standardization of time that came with the rise of railroads right and before Standard Times.\"}"
